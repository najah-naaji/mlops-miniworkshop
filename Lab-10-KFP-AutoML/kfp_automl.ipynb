    "In this lab you develop a continous training and deployment pipeline using Kubeflow Pipelines, BigQuery and AutoML Tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario used in the lab is  predicting customer lifetime value (CLV).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of CLV modeling is to identify the most valuable customers - customers that are going to generate the highest value in a given future time range. The CLV models are built from a variety of data sources - historical sales data being the most important one and in many cases the only one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  is a representative example of a use case where you may need to fine-tune and re-train a predictive model on a frequent basis. As there is a constant flow of new sales transactions that constitute the core of training data, models have to be kept up to date with evolving purchase patterns. Automation of model training and deployment is critical. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the CLV model developed in this lab, the historical sales transactions are preprocessed and aggregated to engineer a set of latent features  representing the so-called RFM characteristics of your customers:\n",
    "- Recency: How active have they been recently?\n",
    "- Frequency: How often do they buy?\n",
    "- Monetary: What amount do they spend?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows a succession of past sales for a set of four customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![clv_timeline](../images/clv-with-offline-training-timeline1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram illustrates the RFM values for the customers, showing for each customer:\n",
    "- Recency: The time between the last purchase and today, represented by the distance between the leftmost circle and the vertical dotted line that's labeled **Now**.\n",
    "- Frequency: The time between purchaes, represented by the distance between the circles on a single line.\n",
    "- Monetary: The amount of money spent on each purchase, represented by the size of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated in the lab you usually create multiple features per each characteristic. For example, in the lab, Recency is captured by two features: *recency* and *T*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFM input features and the target label are engineered using the following process:\n",
    "- A time series of of historical sales transactions for a given customer is divided into two time periods: *the features period* and *the predict period*. A point in time that is used to divide the time series is referred two as *the threshold date*. \n",
    "- The transactions in *the features period* are aggregated to create the latent RFM input features \n",
    "- The transactions in *the predict period* are aggregated to calculate the target label representing the expected total value of the customer\n",
    "\n",
    "This process results in a single example per customer and a set of examples across a customer population constitutes a training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline implemented in the lab, uses BigQuery as a source of historical sales transactions. BigQuery is also used to engineer RFM features. The model is then trained and deployed using AutoML Tables. The below diagram represents the control and data flow implemented by the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training pipeline](../images/clv_train.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The BQ query is run to process sales transactions in the *transactions* table into RFM features in the *features* table. \n",
    "1. The data from the *features* table is imported into the AutoML dataset\n",
    "1. The AutoML model is trained on the imported dataset\n",
    "1. After the training completes the evaluation metrics are retrieved and compared against the performance threshold\n",
    "1. If the model performs better than the threshold the model is deployed to AutoML Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample dataset used in the lab is based on the publicaly available [Online Retail Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original dataset was preprocessed to conform to the following schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Type | Description |\n",
    "|-------|------|-------------|\n",
    "| customer_id | string | A unique customer ID |\n",
    "| order_date | date (yyyy-MM-dd) | The date of a transaction. Transactions (potentially from multiple invoices) are grouped by day |\n",
    "| quantity | integer | A number of items of a single SKU in a transaction |\n",
    "| unit_price | float | A unit price of a SKU |\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature engineering query generates the features table with the below schema. \n",
